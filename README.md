<h1 align="center" id="title">Modeling Vibration from Pile Driving in Bangkok Subsoil Using Neural Networks</h1>

<p id="description">This is the inference part according to the paper 'Modeling Vibration from Pile Driving in Bangkok Subsoil Using Neural Networks</p>

  
  
<h2>üßê Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

*   Estimate the peak partial velocity of pile driving in Bangkok sub soil

<h2>üõ†Ô∏è Installation Steps:</h2>

<p>1. installation</p>

```
git clone https://github.com/Sompote/pile_PPV
```

<p>2. Inference</p>

```
open note book  pile_PPV_inference.ipynb
```

<h2>üç∞ Contribution Guidelines:</h2>

Additional data for pile driving are welcomed to train the model making it more efficient.
